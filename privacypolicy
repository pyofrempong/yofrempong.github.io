1) Who we are
This GPT is provided by Abacie.

2) What data you provide
When you use this GPT, you may enter property details (address/postcode, listing links), financial assumptions (budget, mortgage terms), and other notes you choose to share.

3) What we do with your data
We use your inputs to analyse property investments (e.g., valuation comps, area signals, strategy comparison, and return calculations).

4) Data sent to third-party services (Actions)
To provide results, the GPT may send relevant parts of your input to external public data services, such as:
- Postcode/geocoding services (to convert postcode to coordinates)
- UK crime data services (to summarise crime near coordinates)
- Flood warning/alert services (to check nearby alerts)
- EPC data services (to retrieve EPC details if requested/available)

We only send the minimum information necessary to perform each lookup (e.g., postcode or coordinates).

5) Storage and retention
[Option A: Minimal] We do not intentionally store your inputs.  
[Option B: If you log] We may store limited logs (e.g., timestamp, endpoint called, coarse location) for debugging/security for up to [X] days.

6) Sharing
We do not sell your data. We only share data with third parties as required to fulfil lookups you request.

7) Security
We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect any data we handle.

8) Your choices
Do not enter sensitive personal information. If you want us to delete stored logs (if any).

9) Changes
We may update this policy. The latest version will be posted on this page.
